Composition
=========================

Yann Tiersen's main soundtrack for Amelie and the sin(tan) function seemed to resemble each other.

**NOTE:** This sketch might need calibration on different machines to run properly. Please increment/decrement the _CALIBRATION variable by 0.001 precision until desired results are obtained.

i.e. Aim to get the initial red trigonometric function in sync with the beats of the song.
